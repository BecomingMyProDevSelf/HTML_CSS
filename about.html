        <dt><h3>Nature And Significance</h3></dt>
        <dd>Astrology is a method of predicting mundane events based upon the assumption that the celestial bodies, particularyly the planets and the stars considered
            in their arbitrary combinations or configurations (called constellations), in some way either determine or indicate changes in the sublunar world. The 
            theoretical basis for this assumption lies historically in Hellenistic philosophy and radically distinguishes astrology from the celestial omina("omens")
            that were first categorized and cataloged in ancient Mesopotamia. Originally, astrologers presupposed a geocentric universe in which the "planets"
            (including the Sun and Moon) revolve in orbits whose centres are at or near the centre of the Earth and in which the stars are fixed upon a sphere with a finite
            radius whose centre is also the centre of the Earth. Later the principles of Aristotelian physice were adoptedm according to whic there is an absolute division between the 
            eternal, circular motions of the heavenly element and the limited, linear motions of the four sublunar elements: fire, air, water, earth.

        <dt><h3>Significance of astral omens</h3></dt>
        <dd>The view that the stars make manifest the divine will is closest to the concept that lies behind the ancient Mesopotamian collections of celestial omens.
            Their primary purpose was to inform the royal court of impending disaster or success. These might take the forms of meterological or epidemic phenomena affecting entire
            human, animal, or plant populations. Frequently, however, they involved the military affairs of the state or the personal lives of the ruler and his family.
            Since the celestial omina were regarded not as deterministic but rather as indicative, as a kind of symbolic language in which the gods communicated with men about the 
            future and as only a part of a vast array of ominous events, it was believed that their unpleasant forebodings might be mitigated or nullified by ritual means or by contrary
            omens. The baru (the official prognosticator), who observed and interpreted the clestial omina, was thus in a position to advise his royal employer on the means of avoiding    
            misfortunes; the omens provided a basis for intelligent action rather than an indication of an inexorable fate.

        <dt><h3>Purposes of astrology</h3></dt>
        <dd>The original purpose of astrology, on the other hand, was to inform the individual of the course of his life on the basis of the positions of the planets
            and of the zodiacal signs (the 12 astrological constellations) at the moment of his birth or conception. From this science,c called genthlialogy (casting nativities),
            were developed the fundamental techniques of astrology. The main subdivision of astrology that developed after genethlialogy are general, catarchis, and interrogatory.
            General astrology studies the relationship of the significant celestial moments (e.g., the times of vernal equioxes, eclipses, or planetary conjunctions) to social
            groups, nations, or all of humanity. It answers by astrological means, questions, formerly posed in Mesopotamia to baru.
